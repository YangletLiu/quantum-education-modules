## Overview  

Welcome to the **CSCI 4961: Introduction to Quantum Computing** project! This open-source initiative is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience in quantum computing, equipping you with the skills necessary to excel in future industry and academic endeavors. 

This repository contains course materials, including:
  - **Concepts**: Step-by-step guides on the theory and practical implementation of quantum concepts.
  - **Algorithms**: Real-world examples of quantum algorithms like Shor's and Grover’s algorithms.
  - **Applications**: Exploring quantum solutions in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.
  
We take a modular approach that combines theory with practical experiments using Jupyter notebooks and **RPI's IBM Quantum System One**, aiming to make participants **quantum-proficient**. Our goal is to expand these modules for future courses and projects at RPI.

By completing the modules in this repository, you will:
  - Understand and apply the core principles of quantum computing.
  - Gain hands-on experience using **IBM Quantum System One**.
  - Write and execute quantum algorithms using **Qiskit**.
  - Learn how to solve practical problems with quantum technology.

You can view the modules in the [Documentation](https://quantum-education-modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) site.

## Motivation

The emerging field of quantum computing offers the opportunity for new career paths, research, and collaboration. Contributing to these **open-source** modules facilitates the learning/review of quantum computing fundamentals while also enhancing technical skills suitable for industry. Participants will have the chance to utilize **Qiskit**, one of the highest performing quantum Software Development Kits (SDKs), and experiment with RPI's **IBM Quantum System One**, gaining a competitive edge in the field. Involvement in open-source also enables networking opportunities through collaboration and recognition/credibility as an open-source contributor.

### Long Term Goals

1. **Promote quantum computing in education and research**
2. **Implementation of additional modules**
3. **Categorize into course curriculum**
4. **Revision of modules based on course feedbacks/evaluations**
