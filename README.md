## Overview

CSCI 4961 Introduction to Quantum Computing hopes to connect theory with practice, equipping students with the skills necessary to excel in future industry and academic endeavors. As an introductory course, CSCI 4961 covers fundamental quantum computing concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum algorithms. We adopt a hands-on modular approach focused on labs and projects, supplementing theory through engagement in guided practical experiments using Jupyter notebooks and RPI's **IBM Quantum System One**. In this sense, we aim for anyone working on these modules, whether in development or for course labs/projects, to become **quantum-proficient**. Our goal is to expand upon the modules for future iterations of this course and other quantum-related courses at RPI.

## Motivation

The emerging field of quantum computing offers the opportunity for new career paths, research, and collaboration. Contributing to these **open-source** modules facilitates the learning/review of quantum computing fundamentals while also enhancing technical skills suitable for industry. Participants will have the chance to utilize **Qiskit**, one of the highest performing quantum Software Development Kits (SDKs), and experiment with RPI's **IBM Quantum System One**, gaining a competitive edge in the field. Involvement in open-source also enables networking opportunities through collaboration and recognition/credibility as an open-source contributor.

## Final Deliverables

- **Qiskit codes for quantum concepts, algorithms, and applications**
- **Well-documented Jupyter notebook files**
- **Testing on IBM System One on RPI Campus**
- **Reports highlighting performance of the codes**
