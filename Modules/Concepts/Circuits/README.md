# Concepts: Circuits

Welcome to the **Circuits** folder! This section focuses on important quantum circuits and the essential components of quantum circuits, including the construction and manipulation of qubits and gates. These concepts are fundamental in understanding how quantum algorithms are constructed and executed.

## Structure

The folder is organized as follows, with each topic containing the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and any necessary supporting files (e.g., images).

```
├── Bell States
│   ├── bell_states_images
│   └── bellstates.ipynb
├── Error Codes
│   ├── error_codes_images
│   └── error_codes.ipynb
├── GHZ State
│   ├── ghz_state_images
│   └── ghz_state.ipynb
└── Oracles
    ├── oracles_images
    └── oracles.ipynb

```

Although the folder is organized alphabetically, we recommend the following path to build a coherent understanding if you are just beginning to learn quantum computing:

1. Bell States
2. GHZ State
3. Error Codes
4. Oracles
