# Concepts: Gates

Welcome to the **Gates** folder! This section focuses on the core quantum gates used in quantum computing, exploring their functions, representations, and how they manipulate qubits within quantum circuits.

## Structure

The folder is organized as follows, with each topic containing the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and any necessary supporting files (e.g., images).

```
├── Common Gates
│   ├── common_gates_images
│   └── commongates.ipynb
└── Universal Gate Set
    ├── universal_gate_set_images
    └── universalgateset.ipynb

```

Although the folder is organized alphabetically, we recommend the following path to build a coherent understanding if you are just beginning to learn quantum computing:

1. Common Gates
2. Universal Gate Set
