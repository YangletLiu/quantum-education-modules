# Intermediate Modules: Algorithms

Welcome to the **Algorithms** folder! This section contains intermediate modules that explore quantum algorithms, designed to deepen understanding of how quantum computing can solve problems more efficiently than classical approaches.

## Structure

The folder is organized as follows, with each topic containing the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and any necessary supporting files (e.g., images).

```
├── Bernstein
│   ├── bernsteins_images
│   └── bersteins.ipynb
├── Deutschs
├── Error Correction
├── Grover
├── Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
├── Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
├── Shor
├── Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
└── README.md
```

Although the folder is organized alphabetically, we recommend beginning with the following algorithms first if you are just beginning to learn quantum computing:

1. Deutsch's
2. Bernstein's
3. Simon's
