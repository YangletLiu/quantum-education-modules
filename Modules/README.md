# Quantum Education Modules

Welcome to the **Modules** folder! This folder is organized into three key sections to provide a structured approach to learning quantum computing:
  - **Concepts**: Step-by-step guides on the theory and practical implementation of quantum concepts.
  - **Algorithms**: Real-world examples of quantum algorithms like Shor's and Grover’s algorithms.
  - **Applications**: Exploring quantum solutions in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.

## Structure

The folder is organized as follows, with each topic containing the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and any necessary supporting files (e.g., images).

## Usage Instructions

Each module is designed to supplement course lectures as practical labs/projects. You can access the Jupyter notebooks in one of the following ways:
 - Clone the repository: Download the entire repository by cloning it to your local machine using Git. <br>
  ```git clone https://github.com/YangletLiu/quantum-education-modules.git```

 - Download the notebooks: Alternatively, you can download individual raw files from the repository.

If you prefer not to run the notebooks locally, you can view the pre-run cells on our [documentation website](https://quantum-education-modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, please note that you will not be able to interact with or modify these cells on the website.
